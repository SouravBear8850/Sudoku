# SUDOKU GAME:+1: :rocket: :sparkles:

*The word Sudoku is Japanese and is composed of two parts: Su- meaning ‘number’, and Doku- meaning ‘single’. Rightfully so, as Sudoku is a puzzle where the objective is to fill a 9×9 square grid with digits numbered 1 to 9, so that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3×3 sub-grids contains all of the digits, but absolutely NO duplicates. The puzzle starts out partially filled in i.e some of the numbers are given to you as a starting point as shown for example above. It’s quite the mentally stimulating game and is often featured in newspapers, right beside the crossword.*
